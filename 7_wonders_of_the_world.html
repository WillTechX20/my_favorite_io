                    <h3>Temple of Artemis</h3>
                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis">The Temple of Artemis or Artemision, also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, 
                    local form of the goddess Artemis (associated with Diana, a Roman goddess). It was located in Ephesus 
                    (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and 
                    three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed. 
                    Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.</blockquote>
                    <p>Fun Fact: The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders.</p>
